# AngelDAO: Web3-Powered Crowdfunding Community

***

### AngelDAO is a web3-powered community that offers users a platform to fund verified projects of their choice, and get returns on their investments.
### Being powered by web3, it entails the use of smart contracts for all processes on the block(chain)-end of the solution.  
### This README provides an overview of the AngelDAO project as well as important details for both users and developers  

***

### AngelDAO consists of:

- ###   **[`AngelDollar.sol`](./src/AngelDollar.sol)**: Smart contract that powers Angel Dollar; the native currency of the AngelDAO community.
- ###  **[`AngelGovernanceToken.sol`](./src/AngelGovernanceToken.sol)**: Smart contract that powers the Angel Governance Token, a token which Angels can use to vote for projects in the Angel Court, get access to airdrops, receive community benefits, etc.
- ###  **[`Crowdfunding.sol`](./src/CrowdFunding.sol)**: Smart contract that contains functions used by Benefactors to create campaigns, as well as functions used by Angels to make donations.
- ###  **[`LockTokens.sol`](./src/LockTokens.sol)**: Smart contract that contains functions used by Angels to lock their Angel Dollars in the Angel Pool, and then get Angel Governance Tokens in return.
